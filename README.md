Welcome to the telegram bot for ordering programming services! This project is a simple and easy-to-use telegram bot that allows users to place orders for various programming tasks. The bot provides an interface for users to submit their requests and communicate with the support team.

Features
Easy Navigation: The bot offers clear buttons for different functions like placing an order, accessing personal account, contacting technical support, and learning about the company.
Order Placement: Users can easily provide necessary information such as project title, programming language, technical requirements, budget, and deadline when placing an order.
Confirmation System: Once the user submits their request, they have the option to confirm it before it gets sent to the support team.
